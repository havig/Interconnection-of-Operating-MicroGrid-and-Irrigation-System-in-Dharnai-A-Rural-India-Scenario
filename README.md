# Intelligent-Interconnection-of-Operating-Micro-Grid-and-Irrigation-System-in-Dharnai-A-Rural-Indian Scenario
Disclaimer: The work showcased in the repository is a miniaturized version of the original. This work has been accepted and presented at IEEE GHTC 2019, Seattle, Washington, USA.
The following codes have been uploaded:
1) Load Modelling for Irrigation system considering the pump efficiency, Rainfall parameters and Evapotranspiration of the crops.
2) Domestic Load Modelling for the village Dharnai.
3) Base Design for both the DMG and DIS NOTE: This code involves multiple iterations (Gauss-Seidel Method) and battery Degradation. Multiple variables have been used which might be confusing at first.
4) SETA code for energy transfer without priority. The algortihm considers all the possible events as in Paper and transfers energy based on that.
