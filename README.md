Disclaimer: The work showcased in the repository is a miniaturized version of the original. 
The following code have been uploaded:
1) Load Modelling for both the Micro-Grid System along with its base design code.
2) SETA code for energy transfer without priority. NOTE: The code involves multiple iterations (Gauss-Seidel Method), battery Degradation and also 2 day prediction. Multiple variables have been used which might be confusing.
